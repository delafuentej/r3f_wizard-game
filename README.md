# 🧙 Wizard Game Starter Project

This project demonstrates how easy it is to spawn any type of visual effects (VFX) in your scene using the simple engine we built together.

It is part of a lesson from the course “React Three Fiber – The Ultimate Guide to 3D Web Development” by Wawa Sensei.

It’s a great achievement to have built a game with React Three Fiber. Through this project, I’ve learned a lot about 3D rendering, animations, particles, and game logic.
